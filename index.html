                I possess extensive knowledge of cloud technologies such as MS Azure and AWS, as well as programming languages like C# and web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue. I'm also proficient in SQL Language, SQL Server, Postgres, UML, and other software design methodologies.
                <br /><br /></p><p>
                Beyond technical skills, my business qualifications allow me to seamlessly translate business requirements into actionable IT strategies. This unique combination of skills sets me apart in delivering fit-for-purpose solutions that drive operational efficiency and business growth.
                <br /><br /></p>
                <p>
